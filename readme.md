#### Laravel Project with less package and configurations
This is alternative for creating traditional package for your project with less config and creating basic **CRUD** in your controller. This Project file have such functions to help creating generallly web application which include :
- CRUD (Cread, Read, Update, Delete)
- Upload Image Function
- Paginations Function
- Export to documents
- Filter Functions
- Ajax Validations
- Sweet Alert

So your job is changing name variable and only config *.env*, for front-end this project using bootstrap library for the css, if you wanna make clean just using command 
> php artisan preset none

Is time to make laravel project from traditional way to less and instant. Doing more and fast, simple with your project, get some benefit and more improve your productivity.
